  "body": "Monoarch is a theme for\r\n[Plymouth](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth/) which exhibits\r\na monochrome white on black look and feel. It displays the Arch Linux logo and\r\na spinner. \r\n\r\n![Splash screen preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farsil/monoarch/gh-pages/images/monoarch.png)\r\n\r\n# AUR Package \r\nThe AUR package for this theme is [plymouth-theme-monoarch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plymouth-theme-monoarch/). You may use your favourite AUR helper or proceed with manual installation as described [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages).\r\n\r\nThe package does not alter your Plymouth configuration, you have to change the theme manually. In order to do so, type:\r\n\r\n    # plymouth-set-default-theme -R monoarch\r\n\r\nAnd you're done.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nFiles should be placed in the Plymouth themes directory,\r\nwhich is usually `/usr/share/plymouth/themes`. You may install the theme by simply cloning the repository:\r\n\r\n    # cd /usr/share/plymouth/themes/ \r\n    # git clone https://github.com/farsil/monoarch.git \r\n\r\nRemember to change the Plymouth theme:\r\n\r\n    # plymouth-set-default-theme -R monoarch\r\n\r\n# Removal\r\nSimply remove the directory:\r\n\r\n    # rm -rf /usr/share/plymouth/themes/monoarch\r\n    \r\nRemember to change your theme again otherwise Plymouth will fall back to its \r\ndefault one.\r\n\r\n# Using with distributions other than Arch Linux \r\nNothing prevents you from doing that. If you want to replace the Arch Linux\r\nlogo with your favourite distribution's, you may want to change the\r\n`images/logo.png` file to suit your liking.\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\nDeviantArt user Kahlil88, author of the\r\n[paw-arch](http://kahlil88.deviantart.com/art/Paw-Arch-Plymouth-Theme-208418769)\r\ntheme I used it as a base to build my code.\r\n \r\nArch Linux logo taken from\r\n[https://www.archlinux.org/art/](https://www.archlinux.org/art/).\r\n\r\nSpinner pictures and a large part of code taken from the default Plymouth themes.\r\n",
